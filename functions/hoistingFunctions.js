  The hoisting is the process of moving ONLY the variable declaration to the top of its scope. 
  Just like in the hoisting of variables, the JavaScript interpreter also hoists function 
  declarations. However, as compared to the hoisting of variables, the hoisting of a function 
  declaration is done completey. This means that a function can be called even before it is 
  declared.
