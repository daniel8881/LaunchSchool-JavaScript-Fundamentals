/*
  The console.log(myVar) was put inside the function. When someFunction is invoked. JavaScript
  will check its local scope to find the right variable.

  Variables that are declared at a global scope are accessible anywhere within the prorgram. 
  However, in this instance, Javascript gives priority to the variable with the same name that
  is declared in a local scope. This type of behavior is called shadowing.
