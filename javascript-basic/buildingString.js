There are  bugs and errors.

/*
  When dealing with the long string, for the sake of formatting it in a more readable way.
  We can use string concatenation or escape newline character when press the return key.
  But if there are extra spaces characters after backward slash, it will cause syntax error.
  On line 5 after the backslash there are some extra spaces that lead to an error.

  Also on line 2 to line 6, before each line there are some extra spaces, the spaces will appear
  at the beginning of each new line.
